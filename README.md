Welcome to the Coregulation Search Engine (CORESH) frontend repository! This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for searching co-regulated gene sets within publicly available datasets. The search engine allows researchers and bioinformaticians to explore and analyze gene expression patterns, identifying groups of genes that are co-regulated under different conditions.

## Features

- **Search Interface:** A user-friendly search interface where users can input specific genes.

- **Dataset Selection:** Users can select from a variety of publicly available gene expression datasets to perform their search.

- **Co-regulated Gene Sets:** The search engine employs advanced algorithms to identify and present co-regulated gene sets.

- **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations help users understand the expression patterns and relationships within the identified gene sets.

- **Downloadable Results:** Users can download the results of search engine in form of `csv`-files for further analysis.
